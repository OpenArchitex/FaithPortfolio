summary:
abstract: "In some epidemiological studies, the response measurement of interest is the time to occurrence of an event;
however, the model of choice is the logistic regression model. In logistic regression model, the response
variable is binary unlike survival regression models such as Cox model, where the response variable is
the time-to-event.This talk aims to show that the logistic regression model and the Cox model may yield
different results based on an application of a real data. A study conducted by Caplehorn and Bell in 1991
explored the use of methadone in a cohort of 238 heroin addicts, who were enrolled in either one of the
two clinics (Clinic 1 or 2) offering methadone maintenance treatment. The two clinics differ in their live-in
policies for patients and we would like to investigate which clinic is better at retaining individuals. The
logistic regression model was used to assess the association of type of clinic with treatment cessation. Only
the type of clinic and level of drug dose were obtained as associated with treatment cessation. The Cox
regression model was used to study the effect of the type of clinic on the retention time of the clinic while
adjusting for other significant factors, level of drug dose and prison record. Results from the Cox model
with time-varying effects revealed no significant difference between the two clinics in retention times in
the first 300 days after admission, but Clinic 2 tends to have longer retention times after 300 days."
