I am currently a PhD student (in Statistics) in Quebec City. Previously I worked in a fintech company in Ottawa as a data scientist. I am originally from Singapore and moved to Canada in 2013. I speak English, Chinese and an intermediate level of French. My research interests are in survival analysis, regression analysis, missing data and their applications in the healthcare and financial domain.
