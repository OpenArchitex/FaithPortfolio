I have two years experience as a data scientist at a start-up in Ottawa that created a product to help auditors during their audit experience. I ampassionate about the use of statistics in data analysis but also in software development. My prior research experience has mainly focused on survivalanalysis and longitudinal data analysis, however I am interested in other areas such as machine learning as well.
